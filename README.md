2. Open the Extensions page in your Chrome Browser.
3. Enable deverloper mode (should be a slider on the top right of the Maange Extensions page).
4. Use "Load Unpached" to load the extension.
5. Reload the site you want to use the extension with (the extension only runs when a page is refreshed).

There is no configuration required.


To use as a bookmarklet:
